%
%In this paper, we described how extensible parsing in Wyvern makes for
%a solid platform to support whitespace-delimited, type-directed embedded DSLs. In the
%future, we aim to implement a wide variety of DSLs in Wyvern tweaking
%our approach and implementation thereof to provide a comprehensive example of
%supporting multiple interacting DSLs in a safe and easy-to-use manner.
