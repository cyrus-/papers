	abstract = {Abstract  As large-scale, detailed network modeling projects are flourishing in the field of computational neuroscience, it is more
and more important to design single neuron models that not only capture qualitative features of real neurons but are quantitatively
accurate in silico representations of those. Recent years have seen substantial effort being put in the development of algorithms
for the systematic evaluation and optimization of neuron models with respect to electrophysiological data. It is however difficult
to compare these methods because of the lack of appropriate benchmark tests. Here, we describe one such effort of providing
the community with a standardized set of tests to quantify the performances of single neuron models. Our effort takes the
form of a yearly challenge similar to the ones which have been present in the machine learning community for some time. This
paper gives an account of the first two challenges which took place in 2007 and 2008 and discusses future directions. The
results of the competition suggest that best performance on data obtained from single or double electrode current or conductance
injection is achieved by models that combine features of standard leaky integrate-and-fire models with a second variable reflecting
adaptation, refractoriness, or a dynamic threshold.},

	abstract = {Biologically detailed single neuron and network models are important for understanding how ion channels, synapses and anatomical connectivity underlie the complex electrical behavior of the brain. While neuronal simulators such as {NEURON}, {GENESIS}, {MOOSE}, {NEST}, and {PSICS} facilitate the development of these data-driven neuronal models, the specialized languages they employ are generally not interoperable, limiting model accessibility and preventing reuse of model components and cross-simulator validation. To overcome these problems we have used an Open Source software approach to develop {NeuroML}, a neuronal model description language based on {XML} (Extensible Markup Language). This enables these detailed models and their components to be defined in a standalone form, allowing them to be used across multiple simulators and archived in a standardized format. Here we describe the structure of {NeuroML} and demonstrate its scope by converting into {NeuroML} models of a number of different voltage- and ligand-gated conductances, models of electrical coupling, synaptic transmission and short-term plasticity, together with morphologically detailed models of individual neurons. We have also used these {NeuroML-based} components to develop an highly detailed cortical network model. {NeuroML-based} model descriptions were validated by demonstrating similar model behavior across five independently developed simulators. Although our results confirm that simulations run on different simulators converge, they reveal limits to model interoperability, by showing that for some models convergence only occurs at high levels of spatial and temporal discretisation, when the computational overhead is high. Our development of {NeuroML} as a common description language for biophysically detailed neuronal and network models enables interoperability across multiple simulation environments, thereby improving model transparency, accessibility and reuse in computational neuroscience.},

Despite the prevalence of computing power, the process of finding natural laws and their corresponding equations has resisted automation. A key challenge to finding analytic relations automatically is defining algorithmically what makes a correlation in observed data important and insightful. We propose a principle for the identification of nontriviality. We demonstrated this approach by automatically searching motion-tracking data captured from various physical systems, ranging from simple harmonic oscillators to chaotic double-pendula. Without any prior knowledge about physics, kinematics, or geometry, the algorithm discovered Hamiltonians, Lagrangians, and other laws of geometric and momentum conservation. The discovery rate accelerated as laws found for simpler systems were used to bootstrap explanations for more complex systems, gradually uncovering the "alphabet" used to describe those systems.},

The network principles underlying recognition of short temporal sequences are applied here to speech, but similar ideas can be applied to aspects of vision, touch, and olfaction.

Maintaining a high degree of transparency in scientific reporting is essential not just for gaining trust and credibility within the scientific community but also for facilitating the development of new ideas. Sharing data and computer code associated with publications is becoming increasingly common, motivated partly in response to data deposition requirements from journals and mandates from funders. Despite this increase in transparency, it is still difficult to reproduce or build upon the findings of most scientific publications without access to a more complete workflow.
{FINDINGS:} Version control systems ({VCS)}, which have long been used to maintain code repositories in the software industry, are now finding new applications in science. One such open source {VCS}, Git, provides a lightweight yet robust framework that is ideal for managing the full suite of research outputs such as datasets, statistical code, figures, lab notes, and manuscripts. For individual researchers, Git provides a powerful way to track and compare versions, retrace errors, explore new approaches in a structured manner, while maintaining a full audit trail. For larger collaborative efforts, Git and Git hosting services make it possible for everyone to work asynchronously and merge their contributions at any time, all the while maintaining a complete authorship trail. In this paper I provide an overview of Git along with use-cases that highlight how this tool can be leveraged to make science more reproducible and transparent, foster new collaborations, and support novel uses.},

Using measured brain-activity patterns to evaluate computational network models is complicated by the need to define the correspondency between the units of the model and the channels of the brain-activity data, e.g., single-cell recordings or voxels from functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI).} Similar correspondency problems complicate relating activity patterns between different modalities of brain-activity measurement (e.g., {fMRI} and invasive or scalp electrophysiology), and between subjects and species. In order to bridge these divides, we suggest abstracting from the activity patterns themselves and computing representational dissimilarity matrices ({RDMs)}, which characterize the information carried by a given representation in a brain or model. Building on a rich psychological and mathematical literature on similarity analysis, we propose a new experimental and data-analytical framework called representational similarity analysis ({RSA)}, in which multi-channel measures of neural activity are quantitatively related to each other and to computational theory and behavior by comparing {RDMs.} We demonstrate {RSA} by relating representations of visual objects as measured with {fMRI} in early visual cortex and the fusiform face area to computational models spanning a wide range of complexities. The {RDMs} are simultaneously related via second-level application of multidimensional scaling and tested using randomization and bootstrap techniques. We discuss the broad potential of {RSA}, including novel approaches to experimental design, and argue that these ideas, which have deep roots in psychology and neuroscience, will allow the integrated quantitative analysis of data from all three branches, thus contributing to a more unified systems neuroscience.},

In particular, 'double dipping', the use of the same dataset for selection and selective analysis, will give distorted descriptive statistics and invalid statistical inference whenever the results statistics are not inherently independent of the selection criteria under the null hypothesis. To demonstrate the problem, we apply widely used analyses to noise data known to not contain the experimental effects in question. Spurious effects can appear in the context of both univariate activation analysis and multivariate pattern-information analysis. We suggest a policy for avoiding circularity.},

Clustered data arise most commonly in neuroscience when data are compiled across multiple experiments, for example in electrophysiological or optical recordings taken from synaptic terminals, with each experiment providing a distinct cluster of data. However, there are many other types of experimental design that can yield clustered data. Here, we provide a statistical model for intracluster correlation and systematically investigate a range of methods for analyzing clustered data.
