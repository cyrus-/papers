	Abstract = {Over the past decade, I have performed several field
		 studies with scientists developing software either on
		 their own or together with software engineers. Based on
		 these field study data, I identify a model of
		 scientific software development as practiced in many
		 scientific laboratories and communities. This model
		 does not fit the standard software engineering models.
		 For example, the tasks of requirement elicitation and
		 software evaluation are not clearly delineated.
		 Nevertheless, it appears to be successful within the
		 context in which it is used. In the context in which
		 scientists collaborate with software engineers,
		 however, I describe problems which arose from the clash
		 of this model with a traditional,phased software
		 engineering model. Given these models, I discuss the
		 issues which have to be addressed in order to determine
		 the software techniques and tools which might best
		 support scientific software development in different
		 contexts.},

of semantic preservation) of CompCert, a compiler from Clight (a
large subset of the C programming language) to PowerPC assembly code,
using the Coq proof assistant both for programming the compiler and
for proving its correctness.  Such a verified compiler is useful in
the context of critical software and its formal verification: the
verification of the compiler guarantees that the safety properties
proved on the source code hold for the executable compiled code as
well.},
