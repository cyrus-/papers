% This is a template for a CMU thesis.  It is 18 pages without any content :-)
% The source for this is pulled from a variety of sources and people.
% Here's a partial list of people who may or may have not contributed:
%
%        bnoble   = Brian Noble
%        caruana  = Rich Caruana
%        colohan  = Chris Colohan
%        jab      = Justin Boyan
%        josullvn = Joseph O'Sullivan
%        jrs      = Jonathan Shewchuk
%        kosak    = Corey Kosak
%        mjz      = Matt Zekauskas (mattz@cs)
%        pdinda   = Peter Dinda
%        pfr      = Patrick Riley
%        dkoes = David Koes (me)

% My main contribution is putting everything into a single class files and small
% template since I prefer this to some complicated sprawling directory tree with
% makefiles.

% The other requirements Catherine has:
%
%  - avoid large margins.  She wants the thesis to use fewer pages, 
%    especially if it requires colour printing.
%
%  - The thesis should be formatted for double-sided printing.  This
%    means that all chapters, acknowledgements, table of contents, etc.
%    should start on odd numbered (right facing) pages.
%
%  - You need to use the department standard tech report title page.  I
%    have tried to ensure that the title page here conforms to this
%    standard.
%
%  - Use a nice serif font, such as Times Roman.  Sans serif looks bad.
%
% Other than that, just make it look good...
